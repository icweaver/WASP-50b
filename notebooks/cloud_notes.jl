## $(OO_2017)

* Present a cloud model that takes the microphysics of condensation and coalescence into account, unlike the previous approach by $(AM_2001), which wraps these two processes into $(fsed) as a single free parameter.

* They find that coalescence is driven by differential settling under gravity, which is essential for understanding the later stages of cloud formation, where the cloud particles grow to larger than 10 μm in radius $(R_1978).

## $(GMA_2018)

* $(fsed) study for BDs/sub-stellar objects, taking into account microphysical processes such as cloud particle nucleation rate and condensation nuclei flux


* find that $(fsed) is strongly dependent on (in descending order of impact):

	1) material properties and formation pathways of clouds
	
	2) vertical mixing, as parameterized by $(Kzz) (eddy diffusivity)
	
	3) only slightly dependent on $(g) given constant $(Kzz), but a more realistic representation of $(Kzz) that scales with $(g) (e.g., $(AM_2001)) may tell a different story

* Predict that $(fsed) ∝ depth of cloud base (i.e., decreasing $(Teq)) due to higher abundances of condensate vapor at depth → aiding growth of larger particles

## $(P_2019)

* This work uses a detailed microphysical cloud model to determine the observability of inhomogeneous cloud cover in hot Jupiters


* Cloud formation is inhibited by gravitational settling because it causes cloud particle to fall to hotter regions of
the atmosphere where it quickly evaporates


* Using JWST, it should be possible to detect the presence of cloud inhomogeneities due to its wavelength-dependent signature imparted on phase curves


* Predict that JWST observations can be used to probe for inhomogeneous clouds due to the fact that the observed difference in limb radii in the presence of clouds varies characteristically with wavelength


* Silicate and aluminum clouds can give rise to broad features $(WS_2015) in the IR ∼  10 and 20 μm that should be observable with JWST ($(M_2017), $(V_2020))


* Also find a potentially cloud-free spectral window from ∼5-9 μm where silicate cloud opacity is decreased

## $(D_2021)

* Compiles transmission spectra from 23 warm exoplanets ``(T_\\mathrm{eq} ≤ 1000\\ \\mathrm{K})`` previously observed by
HST to quantify the haziness of each exoplanet using a normalized water absorption feature amplitude ($(A_H))

* They searched for relationships between $(A_H) and other planetary and stellar parameters, and found the most statistically significant linear correlation with the following:
	
	* ``\\log H`` (scale height)
	* $(g)
	* ``\\log \\rho_\\mathrm{p}``

* More specifically, they found that planets with less puffy atmospheres (smaller ``H``), larger $(g), and larger $(ρ_p) tended to be more clear


* Their analytic models also show a tentative trend between $(A_H) and a combination of $(Teq) and $(g):

```math
A_\\mathrm H \\sim log(T^{1/2}/g)
```

## Wrap-up
### $(R_2022)

!!! note
	For an updated approach to the original $(fsed) formalization in $(AM_2001) that allows for non-constant $(fsed) that varies with altitude, and a comprehensive overview of other studies that have investigated the impact of temperature and gravity on cloud formation, we direct readers to this study and the references therein.

* Constant $(fsed) is great when computational efficiency is desired, but allowing it to vary can allow for a much wider of variety of cloud profiles and atmospheric spectra to be modeled
